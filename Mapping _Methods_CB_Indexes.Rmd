# Introduction
CBEP, like other National Estuary Programs will receive additional funding to
support our programs via the "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law" signed into law 
last December.

EPA has recently released guidance for applying for those funds.  A core 
component of the guidance is that overall, the NEP program should comply with 
the White House's "Justice 40" initiative, which requires that "at least 40% of 
the benefits and investments from BIL funding flow to disadvantaged 
communities."

EPA suggested that we use the National-scale 
[EJSCREEN tools](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) to help identify "disadvantaged
communities" in our region. The EPA guidance goes on to suggest we focus on 
five demographic indicators:

*  Percent low-income;  

*  Percent linguistically isolated; 

*  Percent less than high school education;  

*  Percent unemployed; and  

*  Low life expectancy.

This notebook builds on the work in "Calc_Indexes.pdf" to calculate data for the
Casco Bay Watershed Census Tracts, and calculates how Casco Bay Census tracts
compare at National, Statewide, and Regional scales.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(readr)
library(rgdal)
library(sf)   # automatically loads `sp` and `rgdal`
library(broom)  # used to tidy geospatial info to dataframe for ggplot (could use fortify())
#library(rgeos)
```

# Set Graphics Theme
This sets `ggplot()`graphics for no background, no grid lines, etc. in a clean
format suitable for (some) publications.

```{r set_theme}
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Load Data
## Folder References
I use folder references to allow limited indirection, thus making code from 
GitHub repositories more likely to run "out of the box".  

```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
gis_folder <- "GIS_Data"
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

I use the "Original_Data" folder to retain data in the form originally
downloaded.  That minimizes the chances of inadvertently modifying the source 
data. All data was accessed via EJScreen.  The 2021 EJSCREEN Data
was accessed on July 26, 2022, at https://gaftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/2021/.  I 
downloaded geodatabases, and open the geospatial data they contained in ArcGIS
and exported the tabular attribute data to CSV files.  That tabular CSV data is 
provided in the "Original Data" folder here.

The "figures" folder isolates "final" versions of any graphics I produce.  That
just makes it a bit easier to find  final products in what can sometimes be 
fairly large GitHub Repositories (although not here).

## Tabular Data
The Tabular data is quite extensive (over 165 MB), which poses some data access
challenges.  The raw CSV file contains 74001 records, and 166 columns.  Most,
but not all are numeric.  The Health data is slightly smaller in length, and has 
only a handful of relevant data columns, but it DOES include State ad County 
names, which are more convenient that the GEOID10 values to search.

```{r}
cb_data <- read_csv("cb_tracts_indexes.csv",    
                     col_types = paste0('ccddd--', rep('d', 41)))
```

## Geospatial Data
We have geospatial data, in UTM coordinates.

```{r}
the_file_name <- 'casco_ejscreen_utm.shp' 
the_path <- file.path(gis_folder, the_file_name)
cb_geospatial <- readOGR(the_path )

the_file_name <- 'casco_watershed_utm.shp' 
the_path <- file.path(gis_folder, the_file_name)
cb_watershed <- readOGR(the_path )

the_file_name <- 'watershed_outline.shp' 
the_path <- file.path(gis_folder, the_file_name)
cb_watershed_outline <- readOGR(the_path )

the_file_name <- 'Maine.shp' 
the_path <- file.path(gis_folder, the_file_name)
Maine <- readOGR(the_path )

```

# Initial Plot

Note that if you pass the geospatial layer to `ggplot` without manually 
converting it (using `tidy()` from `broom`, or `fortify()`, buried in `ggplot2`,
`ggplot()` still figures out what to do, but makes some default decisions
about how to define the polygons that may or may not be correct.  For 
a sample map, as here, they appear to work pretty well.

```{r}
plt <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = cb_geospatial, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill="#69b3a2", color="white") +
  geom_path(data = cb_watershed_outline, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group),
            color="grey40") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey85')) +
  coord_equal()
plt
```

That's a good start, but it would be nice to provide a Maine state background.
To do that, we need to find the current coordinates and apply them after we add 
Maine  (which is larger) to the map.

```{r}
xlims <- layer_scales(plt)$x$range$range
ylims <- layer_scales(plt)$y$range$range
```

```{r}
plt <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  geom_polygon(data = cb_geospatial, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill="#69b3a2", color="white") +
  geom_path(data = cb_watershed_outline, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = NA, color="grey40") +
 
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey85')) +
  coord_equal(xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims)
plt
```

# Merge Tablular Data and Geospatial Data
The object the shapefile has become (Technically, a "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame")
contains a dataframe in its `@data` slot, but manipulating it directly appears
to lead to unpredictable behavior. However, `sp` includes a `merge()` method for
these S4 objects, when paired with a dataframe.  This works as one might expect.
(Note that `sp` also contains an `as.data.frame()` method that extracts this
information without requiring access to the slot directly.)

```{r}
names(cb_geospatial@data)
```
```{r}
tmp <- cb_data %>%
  select(c('GEOID10', "LIFEEXP":"UNEMPPCT", -LIFEEXP_SE, NEG_LIFEEXP, Index_1:p_Index_2))

```

But we run into problems creating a "fortified" data frame for ggplot that 
contains the identifier we need in the next step to allow us to merge the 
geospatial data with the tabular data.

```{r error = TRUE} 
cb_geospatial_df <- tidy(cb_geospatial, region = "GEOID10")
```

```{r error = TRUE} 
cb_geospatial_df <- tidy(cb_geospatial, region = "GEOID10")
```

A little Googling revealed that `maptools` (apparently called by `sp`, which is 
called by either `sf` or `rgdal`) relies on other packages to handle polygon 
geometries. Calling either `tidy()` or `fortify()` on a polygon map layer
with a `region` argument triggers calls to functions from one of these other
packages.

The help files for `maptools::checkPolygonHoles()` provides a bit more detail.

Apparently, `gpclip` has a restrictive license, so you need to formally grant
permission to `gpclip`. but the  help file says use of the `rgeos` package 
functions is preferred.

So, after I installed and loaded the `rgeos` package, all is well...
But note the warning about future changes. Since I have never called any `rgeos`
functions directly, I'm not sure how we will need to change code in the future. 

```{r}
library(rgeos)

cb_geospatial_df <- tidy(cb_geospatial, region = "GEOID10")
```

```{r}
cb_geospatial_df <- cb_geospatial_df %>%
  left_join(tmp, by = c('id' = 'GEOID10'))
```

```{r}
names(cb_geospatial_df)
```

# Revised Plot
With severa lother improvements...

```{r}
plt <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  geom_polygon(data = cb_geospatial_df, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group,
                                          fill = Index_2), color="white") +
  geom_path(data = cb_watershed_outline, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = NA, color="grey40") +
  geom_path(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option = 'B', na.value = "grey75") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey85')) +
  coord_equal(xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims)
plt
```

# Creating A Faceted Map Display
## Building the Tibble
To create a `facet_wrap()` display on multiple panels, I need to build a
suitable long tibble.  It's not entirely obvious how to go about that.

We start with a map showing which Census Tracts in the Casco Bay region exceed
the (regional) 80th percentile on each of my proposed thresholds.

Only two census Tracts exceed the Maine 80th percentile threshold, and none
exceed the Federal 80th percentile thresholds.  That makes maps of those values
fairly useless.  Fourteen census tracts  exceed the regional 80th percentile 
threshold (by definition of the 80th percentile).

```{r}
tmp <- cb_data %>% 
  select(GEOID10, Ex_CB_Index_1:Ex_CB_PCA_Index_V2)
```

First, we create a "fortified" tibble, as required for mapping with `ggplot()`.
```{r}
cb_geospatial_df <- tidy(cb_geospatial, region = "GEOID10")
cb_geospatial_df <- cb_geospatial_df %>%
  left_join(tmp, by = c('id' = 'GEOID10'))
```

Then we simplify the column names.
```{r}
cb_geospatial_df_2 <- cb_geospatial_df %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub('Ex_CB_', '', x)) 
```

And finally, pivot the fortified data frame into long format.  Note that this
creates a **large** data frame which we probably don't want to keep around
any longer than necessary.

```{r}
cb_geospatial_df_2 <- cb_geospatial_df_2 %>%
  pivot_longer(Index_1:PCA_Index_V2, 
               names_to = 'Threshold', values_to = 'Value')
```


## Facet Plot Demo
This ggplot object is fairly complex, so it takes some time to render.
Rendering time can be shortened somewhat by using simpler polygon geometries.

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plt <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  geom_polygon(data = cb_geospatial_df_2, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group,
                                          fill = Value), color="white") +
  geom_path(data = cb_watershed_outline, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = NA, color="gray40") +
  geom_path(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  
  facet_wrap(~ Threshold, nrow = 2) +
  
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = 'D', na.value = "grey75", name = 'Exceeds') +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey85'),
        legend.position = 'bottom') +
  coord_equal(xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims)
plt
```

What that shows is that thresholds based on indexes constructed by looking at 
raw scores generally identify more mid-watershed areas, while indexes based 
on national percentiles tend to identify more locations in Portland and South Portland. This presumably reflects the greater weighting of income in the 
former, compared to other metrics of disadvantage.


# National Percentiles of Indicators
```{r}
tmp <- cb_data %>% 
  select(GEOID10, p_NEG_LIFEEXP:p_UNEMPPCT) %>%
  mutate(across(p_NEG_LIFEEXP:p_UNEMPPCT, rank, 
         na.last = TRUE, ties.method = 'average'))

cb_geospatial_df <- tidy(cb_geospatial, region = "GEOID10")
cb_geospatial_df <- cb_geospatial_df %>%
  left_join(tmp, by = c('id' = 'GEOID10'))

cb_geospatial_df_2 <- cb_geospatial_df %>%
  pivot_longer(p_NEG_LIFEEXP:p_UNEMPPCT, 
               names_to = 'Indicator', values_to = 'Value')
```

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
plt <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  geom_polygon(data = cb_geospatial_df_2, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group,
                                          fill = Value), color="white") +
    geom_path(data = cb_watershed_outline, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = NA, color="grey40") +
  geom_path(data = Maine, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
                fill = 'grey50', color='grey10')  +
  
  facet_wrap(~ Indicator, nrow = 2) +
  
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option = 'B', na.value = "grey75", name = 'Exceeds') +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey85'),
        legend.position = 'bottom') +
  coord_equal(xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims)
plt
```

## Zoom in on Portland Region
```{r}
xlims
ylims
```
```{r}
new_x_low <- xlims[1] + 3* (xlims[2]-xlims[1])/6
new_x_high <- xlims[1] + 4* (xlims[2]-xlims[1])/6

new_y_low <- ylims[1] +  (ylims[2]-ylims[1])/12
new_y_high <- ylims[1] + 3*(ylims[2]-ylims[1])/12

new_xlims <- c(new_x_low, new_x_high)
new_ylims <- c(new_y_low, new_y_high)
```


```{r}
 plt + 
  coord_equal(xlim = new_xlims, ylim = new_ylims)
```
So, several of these pick up the subsidized housing and homeless community in 
Portland's Back Cove neighborhood. Other than that, what is striking is the fact
that the ranks of the different metrics are not all that correlated in this
smaller sub-region, which may help explain why few locations are flagged by any of
the candidate indicators.



# Ranks of Indicators
