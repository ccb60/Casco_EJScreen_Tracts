# Introduction
CBEP, like other National Estuary Programs will receive additional funding to
support our programs via the "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law" signed into law 
last December.

EPA has recently released guidance for applying for those funds.  A core 
component of the guidance is that overall, the NEP program should comply with 
the White House's "Justice 40" initiative, which requires that "at least 40% of 
the benefits and investments from BIL funding flow to disadvantaged 
communities."

EPA suggested that we use the National-scale 
[EJSCREEN tools](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) to help identify "disadvantaged
communities" in our region. The EPA guidance goes on to suggest we focus on 
five demographic indicators:

*  Percent low-income;  

*  Percent linguistically isolated; 

*  Percent less than high school education;  

*  Percent unemployed; and  

*  Low life expectancy.

This notebook examines the distributions of EPA's suggested demographic
indicators in the Casco Bay Region.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(readr)
```

# Set Graphics Theme
This sets `ggplot()`graphics for no background, no grid lines, etc. in a clean
format suitable for (some) publications.

```{r set_theme}
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Load Data
```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
gis_folder <- "GIS_Data"
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

```{r}
cb_indexes <- read_csv("cb_tracts_indexes.csv",    
                     col_types = paste0('cdd--', rep('d', 23)))
```

# Metrics
## Summaries
```{r}
summary(cb_indexes[,4:10])
```

Note that more than 50% of our census tracts report no linguistic isolation. In
our region, this is a surrogate largely for immigrants in Portland.

## Pairs Plot
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
cb_indexes %>%
  select( "NEG_LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

Data (except life expectancy) is not normally distributed, especially for those
metrics that have mostly low values. That is not unexpected for percents.
which are bounded below by zero, and are a transformation of count data.

Adding or averaging raw values will lead to  indexes dominated by the
sub-indexes with the largest variance.

# National Percentiles
## Summaries
```{r}
summary(cb_indexes[,11:15]) 
```

## Pairs Plot
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
cb_indexes %>%
  select( c(P_NEG_LIFEEXP:P_UNEMPPCT)) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```


# Indexes
## Summaries
As a reminder:

*  Index 1 is a mean of the raw scores

*  index 2 is a mean of national percentiles.(This may be what EPA wants)

*  P_Index_1 is national percentiles of Index 1

*  p_Index_2 is national percentile of index 2

*  PCA_Index_V1 is the first PCA axis of a (scaed) PCA on raw scores

*  PCA_Index_V2 is the first PCA Axis of a (Scaeld)PCA on national percentiles.

```{r}
summary(cb_indexes[,21:26])
```

## Pairs Plot
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
cb_indexes %>%
  select( Index_1:PCA_Index_V2) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```
