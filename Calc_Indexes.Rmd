# Introduction
CBEP, like other National Estuary Programs will receive additional funding to
support our programs via the "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law" signed into law 
last December.

EPA has recently released guidance for applying for those funds.  A core 
component of the guidance is that overall, the NEP program should comply with 
the White House's "Justice 40" initiative, which requires that "at least 40% of 
the benefits and investments from BIL funding flow to disadvantaged 
communities."

EPA suggested that we use the National-scale 
[EJSCREEN tools](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) to help identify "disadvantaged
communities" in our region. The EPA guidance goes on to suggest we focus on 
five demographic indicators:

*  Percent low-income;  

*  Percent linguistically isolated; 

*  Percent less than high school education;  

*  Percent unemployed; and  

*  Low life expectancy.

This notebook examines the distributions of EPA's suggested demographic
indicators and calculates relevant composite indexes a couple of different ways,
and calculates how Casco Bay Census tracts compare at national, Statewide, and
Local scales.

# Load Data

## Folder References
I use folder references to allow limited indirection, thus making code from 
GitHub repositories more likely to run "out of the box".  

```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

I use the "Original_Data" folder to retain data in the form originally
downloaded.  That minimizes the chances of inadvertently modifying the source 
data. All data was accessed via EJScreen.  The 2021 EJSCREEN Data
was accessed on July 26, 2022, at https://gaftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/2021/.  I 
downloaded geodatabases, and open the geospatial data they contained in ArcGIS
and exported the tabular attribute data to CSV files.  That tabular CSV data is 
provided in the "Original Data" folder here.

The "figures" folder isolates "final" versions of any graphics I produce.  That
just makes it a bit easier to find  final products in what can sometimes be 
fairly large GitHub Repositories (although not here).

## Load Data
The tabular (National) source data is quite extensive (over 50 MB), so I have
not included it in the GitHub repository (GitHub does not appreciate files over
100 MB).  The raw CSV file contains 74001 records, and 166 columns.  Most, but
not all are numeric. The Health data is significantly smaller. smaller.  The large files also poses potential data access challenges in R.

I read in just the required data columns for now.

```{r}
the_file <- 'EJSCREEN_Full_tracts.txt' 
the_path <- file.path(data_folder, the_file)
the_data <- read_csv(the_path,
                     n_max = 74001,
                     col_types = cols_only(
                       ID = col_character(),
                       LOWINCPCT = col_double(),
                       LINGISOPCT = col_double(),
                       LESSHSPCT  = col_double(),
                       UNEMPPCT = col_double(),
                       P_LWINCPCT = col_double(),
                       P_LNGISPCT = col_double(),
                       P_LESHSPCT  = col_double(),
                       P_UNEMPPCT = col_double()))
```


```{r}
the_file <- 'Tract2010_LifeExpectancy.txt' 
the_path <- file.path(data_folder, the_file)
life_data <- read_csv(the_path,
                      n_max = 73057,
                      col_types = cols_only(LIFEEXP = col_double(),
                                            GEOID10 = col_character(),
                                            State = col_character(),
                                            County = col_character(),
                                            Life_Expectancy_Standard_Error = col_double(),
                                            Shape_Length = col_double(),
                                            Shape_Area = col_double()))

```

```{r}
miles_per_meter <- 0.000621371
sq_miles_per_sq_meters <- miles_per_meter^2
```

```{r}
the_data <- inner_join(life_data, the_data, by = c('GEOID10' = 'ID')) %>%
  relocate(LIFEEXP , .after = County) %>%
  rename(LIFEEXP_SE = Life_Expectancy_Standard_Error,
         Perimeter = Shape_Length,
         Area = Shape_Area) %>%
  mutate(Perimeter_km = Perimeter / 1000,
         Perimeter = Perimeter * miles_per_meter,
         Area_ha = Area / 10000,
         Area = Area * sq_miles_per_sq_meters,
         Shape_Index = Area / Perimeter^2) %>%
  mutate(NEG_LIFEEXP = 150 - LIFEEXP,             # Higher life expectancy is good
         LOWINCPCT = 100* LOWINCPCT, 
         LESSHSPCT = 100* LESSHSPCT,
         LINGISOPCT =  100* LINGISOPCT,
         UNEMPPCT   = 100* UNEMPPCT) %>%
  relocate(Perimeter, Area, .after = Area_ha) %>%
  relocate(NEG_LIFEEXP, .after = LIFEEXP_SE)
  
rm(life_data)
```

# Utility Functions
```{r}
quick_sum <- function(.dat)
  return(list(Mean = mean(.dat, na.rm = TRUE),
              SD = sd(.dat, na.rm = TRUE),
              Median = median(.dat, na.rm = TRUE),
              IQR = IQR(.dat, na.rm = TRUE)
              ))
```

```{r}
quick_percentile <- function(.dat) {
  L <- sum(! is.na(.dat))
  val <- rank(.dat) / L
  val[is.na(.dat)] <- NA
  return(val)
  }
```

# Functions for Calculating Indexes
```{r}
calc_index_1 <- function(.data) {
  index_1 <- with(.data,
    (NEG_LIFEEXP + LOWINCPCT + LESSHSPCT +LINGISOPCT + UNEMPPCT) / 5)
  return(index_1)
}
```

The primary alternative is to calculate percentiles within each sub-index, and
sum those.  That makes the composite index approximately scale-free in each 
sub-index.  Again, because of correlations among sub-indexes, that won't be 
quite correct, but it will be close.

```{r}
calc_index_2 <- function(.data) {
  index_2 <- with(.data,
                  (P_NEG_LIFEEXP + P_LWINCPCT + P_LESHSPCT +
                     P_LNGISPCT +
                     P_UNEMPPCT) / 5)
  return(index_2)
}
```

# More  Calculations
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>% 
  mutate(P_NEG_LIFEEXP = quick_percentile(NEG_LIFEEXP) * 100) %>%
  relocate(P_NEG_LIFEEXP, .before = P_LWINCPCT)
```

The following depends on having columns with the correct names, and there is
no error checking....

*  Index_1 is based on averaging the VALUES
*  Index_2 is based on averaging the PERCENTILES
*  P_Index_1 records the percentiles of Index 1, and is thus scale-free.
*  P_Index_2 shows percentiles of Index 2.
```{r}
the_data$Index_1 <- calc_index_1(the_data)
the_data$Index_2 <- calc_index_2(the_data)
the_data$P_Index_1 <- quick_percentile(the_data$Index_1)
the_data$P_Index_2 <- quick_percentile(the_data$Index_2)
```

# Distributions
## Pairs Plot
`GGPairs` runs slowly because of the amount of data involved.  In addition, this
graphic ends up taking a huge amount of space in the final PDF. WE reduce plot
complexity by plotting only a a 5% sample of the data.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
the_data %>%
  select( "LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.05, replace = FALSE) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

Data (except life expectancy) is not normally distributed, especially for those
sub-indexes that have mostly low values. That is not unexpected for percents.
which are bounded below by zero, and are a transformation of count data. 

Adding or averaging raw values will lead to  indexes dominated by the
sub-indexes with the largest variance. For some analyses, I would consider data
transformations, but that will not be needed here, since I will work with
percentiles instead.

## Means, SD, Medians and IGR
```{r}
the_data %>%
  select( "LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  map(quick_sum) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  array(dim = c(4,5),
        dimnames = list(c('Mean', 'SD', 'Median', 'IQR'),
                        c("NEG_LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", 
                          "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" )))
```

Simply adding these indexes together will, roughly speaking, end up with an
index that will emphasize poverty about twice as much as the lack of high school 
education and about four times as much as the other indicators. Moderate to
high correlations among predictors will affect that somewhat, but the general 
idea is sound.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
the_data %>%
  select( "P_NEG_LIFEEXP", "P_LWINCPCT", "P_LESHSPCT", "P_LNGISPCT","P_UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.02, replace = FALSE) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

# PCA Analysis of Sub-indexes
We can get more formal about the relationships between the different sub-indexes
by calculating a Principal Components Analysis. The first PCA axis shows the
"best fit" line through the multi-dimensional cloud of points defined by the set
of sub-indexes.  The second PCA axis defines the "best fit" line through the
remaining variation, and so on.

The first PCA axis can be thought of as a linear combination of the sub-indexes.
The average of the sub-indexes (as suggested in the funding memo) is another
linear combination of the sub-indexes. In a specific sense, the first PCA axis
is the optimal linear combination of the sub-indexes for summarizing the
multidimensional data with just a single value.

### Function for Plotting PCAs
I encapsulate the logic of plotting the PCA results just to simplify later code
```{r}
plot_pca<- function(.pca, .scale = 2.5, .ann_space = 0.15,
                    .levels = c('NEG_LIFEEXP', 'LOWINCPCT', 'LESSHSPCT', 
                                'LINGISOPCT', 'UNEMPPCT'),
                    .labels = c('Short Life', 'Income', 'School', 
                                'Language', 'Unempl'),
                    .title = 'Principal Components Analysis')  {
  # .scale:  how much to expand the arrows to make them fit well against the plot
  # .ann_space: How far past the end of the arrow to place annotations
  
  # Gather the first two PCA axes as unit length vectors
  arrows <- as_tibble(.pca$rotation[,1:2]) %>%
     rename(PC1_Raw = PC1,
            PC2_Raw = PC2)
  
  # Scale length of each vector according to the standard deviations of 
  # the relevant principal components (actually the square root of the 
  # eigenvalues of the covariance matrix).
  
  scaled_arrows <-  pca$rotation %*% diag(pca$sdev) * .scale
  
  # Build the tibble containing  data to plot
  scaled_arrows <- as_tibble(scaled_arrows,
                             rownames = 'Variable', 
                             .name_repair = ~paste0('PC', 1:5)) %>%
    select(Variable, PC1, PC2) %>%
    bind_cols(arrows) %>%
    mutate(ann1 = PC1 + .scale * .ann_space * PC1_Raw,
           ann2 = PC2 + .scale * .ann_space * PC2_Raw) %>%
    select(-PC1_Raw, -PC2_Raw) %>%
    mutate(Variable = factor(Variable, 
                             levels = .levels,
                             labels = .labels ))
  
  plt <- ggplot(as_tibble(pca$x), aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = 'grey15') +
  #geom_density_2d(color = 'grey65') +
  geom_segment(data = scaled_arrows, 
               mapping = aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = PC1, yend = PC2),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, 'cm'), type = 'open'),
               color = 'grey85') +
  geom_text(data = scaled_arrows, 
            mapping = aes(x = ann1, y = ann2, label = Variable),
            color = 'grey85', size = 2.5) +
    ggtitle(.title) +
  theme_dark()
  
  return(plt)
}
```

### Function to Calculate First PCA Axis Scores
I calculate scores anew to avoid alignment problems caused by missing data.
```{r}
calc_scores <- function(.dat, .pca) {
  names <- rownames(.pca$rotation)
  vals <- map(names, ~.dat[,.])
  vals <- do.call(cbind, vals)  # converts list of vectors to data frame
  vals <- as.matrix(vals)
  
  mults <- matrix(.pca$rotation[,1], nrow = length(.pca$rotation[,1]))
  print(mults)
  res <- vals %*% mults
  return(as.vector(res))
}
```

## Raw Values, Unscaled
First, I run a PCA on unscaled values. This highlights the fact that the
"optimal" linear combination will depend on the standard errors of the 
sub-indexes. That means the PCA (like the simple average proposed in the memo)
will depend on the units used to express each of the sub-indexes. In this 
context, that is probably not ideal.  IF we are trying to identify disadvantaged
communities, it should not matter whether life expectancy is measured in years of months, or whether the unemployment rate is expressed as a percent or a 
proportion.

```{r}
pca <- the_data %>%
  select( "NEG_LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
prcomp(scale. = FALSE)
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```

The first two axes account for 92% of the variation in the sub-indexes.

```{r}
pca$rotation
```

The first axis is closely associated with percent low income people in each
census Tract.  That is because the standard deviation of the income indicator
is about double the standard error of the second most variable indicator.

```{r}
plot_pca(pca, .scale = 3, .ann_space = 1)
```

What we see is that the principal structure in the sub-indexes (when unscaled) 
is correlated with income and somewhat correlated  with education. Linguistic 
isolation and education provide a fair amount of independent information via
the second PCA Axis.

## Scaled PCA
A scaled PCA first standardizes all variables to unit variance before
conducting the PCA, thus making sure that changing units won't change results.

```{r}
pca <- the_data %>%
  select( "NEG_LIFEEXP", "LOWINCPCT", "LESSHSPCT", "LINGISOPCT","UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
prcomp(scale. = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```

This explains less of the overall variation in the first two PCA axes,
confirming that some of the apparent pattern in the data was driven by the
different standard deviations of the predictors.

```{r}
pca$rotation
```

```{r}
plot_pca(pca, .scale = 4)
```

When variables are standardized to unit variance, the dominant axis is 
moderately correlated with all the sub-indexes, especially income and education.
That suggests a common structure of community vulnerability. Language and to a
lesser extent life expectancy are most heavily loaded on the second PCA axis.

This suggests that an index that is NOT based on scaled values of percentiles 
will largely function as a surrogate for income, while if the index is based on
scaled values or percentiles, the index will reflect the effects of several 
different sources of disadvantage.

```{r}
the_data$PCA_Index_V1 <- calc_scores(the_data, pca)
```

## Percentiles
```{r}
pca <- the_data %>%
  select( "P_NEG_LIFEEXP", "P_LWINCPCT", "P_LESHSPCT",
          "P_LNGISPCT","P_UNEMPPCT" ) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
prcomp(scale. = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```
The first two axes account for only 76% of the pattern in the sub-indexes.

```{r}
pca$rotation
```

Here, linguistics plays little role in Axis 1, but it dominates Axis 2. It is 
interesting that pecentile of (negative) life expectancy decreases the
axis 2 score, while linguistic isolation sharply increases it.

```{r}
plot_pca(pca, .scale = 3, .ann_space = .2,
         .levels = c(  "P_NEG_LIFEEXP", "P_LWINCPCT", "P_LESHSPCT",
          "P_LNGISPCT","P_UNEMPPCT" ))
```

So, an index based on the (national) percentiles of the scores produces a PCA
with less structure, as expected.  Here axis 1 is a composite of all the
sub-indexes, with the strongest association with Schooling, Income and
Unemployment. Axis 2 is principally linguistic isolation, but also has moderate
loading for unemployment.


```{r}
the_data$PCA_Index_V2 <- calc_scores(the_data, pca)
```

# Examining Results
## Correlations
The Raw indexes are highly correlated with each of the sub-indexes, but 
especially with income and education.

```{r}
the_data %>%
select(NEG_LIFEEXP, LOWINCPCT, LESSHSPCT, LINGISOPCT, UNEMPPCT, 
       Index_1, Index_2) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise')  %>%
  round(3)
```
 
Rank correlations are roughly scale-free, so provide a more robust alternative 
where some metrics (as here) are not normally distributed.
```{r}
the_data %>%
select(NEG_LIFEEXP, LOWINCPCT, LESSHSPCT, LINGISOPCT, UNEMPPCT, 
       Index_1, Index_2) %>%
  cor(method = 'spearman', use = 'pairwise') %>%
  round(3)
```

The composite indexes are highly correlated, as expected.

```{r}
the_data %>%
select(c(Index_1:PCA_Index_V2)) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')  %>%
  round(3)
```
Note that the PCA Index scores are **negatively** correlated with the other
metrics. PCA, like most ordinations, is defined only to reflections.  We swap 
the sign here.

```{r}
the_data$PCA_Index_V1 <- -the_data$PCA_Index_V1
the_data$PCA_Index_V2 <- -the_data$PCA_Index_V2
```

Rank correlations are even higher.
```{r}
the_data %>%
select(c(Index_1, Index_2, P_Index_1, P_Index_2,  PCA_Index_V1, PCA_Index_V2)) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'spearman')  %>%
  round(3)
```

So, the raw index and the PCA indexes based on the same measurements are highly
correlated, as one might expect. one is a simple average, the other a weighted 
average of the same five basic metrics.

## Graphics
I plot only 5% of the data, to reduce the size of the PDF file....

```{r}
p80_sum <- quantile(the_data$Index_1, 0.8, na.rm = TRUE)
p80_sum_of_p  <- quantile(the_data$Index_2, 0.8, na.rm = TRUE)

plt <- the_data %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Index_1, Index_2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 21) +
  geom_density_2d(color = 'green') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p80_sum, color = 'blue') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = p80_sum_of_p, color = 'blue') +

  xlab( 'Mean of Values') +
  ylab( 'Mean of Percentiles') +
  ggtitle('Comparison of Candidate Indexes')
plt
```

The relationship between the indexes is not linear, but correlations 
are likely to be high over any finite range.  Unfortunately, the correlations 
appear less robust at higher index values, exactly where we may want the most
precision. The Blue lines represent the 80th percentiles in each axis.  Note
that the 80th percentile of the mean of five percentiles lies well below 80.

The relationship between the percentiles are close to linear, but each index is
much closer -- although not identical.

```{r}
p80_sum <- quantile(the_data$P_Index_1, 0.8, na.rm = TRUE)
p80_sum_of_p  <- quantile(the_data$P_Index_2, 0.8, na.rm = TRUE)

plt <- the_data %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(P_Index_1, P_Index_2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, shape = 21) +
  geom_density_2d(color = 'green') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p80_sum, color = 'blue') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = p80_sum_of_p, color = 'blue') +
  xlab( 'Percentiles of Mean of Values') +
  ylab( 'Percentiles of Mean of Percentiles') +
  ggtitle('Comparison of Percentiles of\nCandidate Indexes') +
  coord_fixed()
plt
```

Here the percentiles DO fall 

## Pairs Plot of All Indexes
Again, I reduce plot complexity by plotting only 5% of the data.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
the_data %>%
select(c(Index_1:PCA_Index_V2)) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.05, replace = FALSE) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

A few observations:

* Taking percentiles has the effect of spreading out the tails of
the distributions.  

* The two PCA indexes are highly correlated with their 

* Generally, correlations are highest within "Group 1" (raw data) or "Group 2"
(percentiles).  

* Correlations are high enough between the PCA-based nd simple average based
index so as to make little practical difference. There is probably no reason to 
continue to consider the PCA based metrics (and if there were, I'd want to 
explore data transformations).
